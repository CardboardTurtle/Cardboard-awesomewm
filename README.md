awesome config

it does contain some of my wallpapers, you don't need to download that folder if you don't want to, its just eight megs of various images.

I can't remember if I used lain or not so if things are broken probably a good idea to install it
lain (https://github.com/lcpz/lain/wiki)

unless you use the same programs I do, empty out autorun.sh

uses vim like keybindings
super + f4 runs the xkill command, which turns mouse pointer into X that kills whatever program you click on
super + w launches brave, change line at bottom of config to whatever web browser you use
super + e launches pcmanfm, my file manager of choice. change to whatever file manager you use, also located at bottom of config.
