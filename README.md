# Cardboard-awesomewm
my window manager
how to install
1. install awesomewm
2. make directory ~/.config/awesome
3. put rc.lua in there

done.

for help press super+s.

it does contain some of my wallpapers, you don't need to download that folder if you don't want to, its just eight megs of images.

NOTE: at the bottom it disables some input things like trackpad and mouse acceleration for whatever is id 12 (the mouse in my case) just delete the xinput lines to disable.

DEPENDENCIES:

steam

element

compton

nitrogen

firefox

xinput

pasystray

if you don't want to install any of these dependencies, go to the botton of the config where --autostart is and delete the lines starting the program you don't want/have.
